I am a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography working with [Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.ucsd.edu) and [Ilkay Altintas](https://words.sdsc.edu/ilkay/). In December 2022, I completed my PhD in Atmosphere, Oceans, and Climate Dynamics at Yale University, working with [Alexey Fedorov](https://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/alexey-fedorov/about) and [Mary-Louise Timmermanns](https://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/mary-louise-timmermans/about). I am generally interested in tropical climate dynamics, as deep convection in the tropics drives global atmospheric circulations, and exerts profound influences on mid-latitude weather and climate. My research topics range from the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation, Madden-Julian Oscillation, to tropical cyclones. I am currently actively applying AI/ ML to my research.
